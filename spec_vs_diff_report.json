  "summary": "The diff implements all three requirements. REQ-9 is addressed in backend/main.mo with admin-only guards on all write operations and public read access. REQ-10 is addressed in Navigation.tsx (Login/Logout button, admin controls gated by isAdmin) and in BlogPostCard.tsx, PortfolioCard.tsx, BlogListingPage.tsx, BlogDetailPage.tsx, and PortfolioPage.tsx (Edit/Delete/Add controls hidden from unauthenticated users). REQ-11 is addressed in AdminBlogPage.tsx and AdminPortfolioPage.tsx with AccessDeniedScreen for both unauthenticated and unauthorized states. Overall coverage appears complete with no obvious missing requirements or hallucinated features beyond the scope.",
